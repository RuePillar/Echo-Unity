=== case1_start ===
You arrive at the Neo-Tokyo corporate plaza. Rain slicks the chrome surfaces.
A young man's body lies surrounded by police drones.

CAPTAIN REYES: "Echo Agent. About time. We've got a protester dead - Alex Chen, 24."
CAPTAIN REYES: "Corporate security says it was an accident. The crowd says otherwise."
CAPTAIN REYES: "Scan what you need, but be careful. This area's politically charged."

+ [Scan the victim's echo] -> scan_victim
+ [Talk to Captain Reyes] -> talk_reyes
+ [Examine the scene physically] -> examine_scene

=== scan_victim ===
You activate your echo scanner. The device hums as it syncs with the residual neural energy...

ALEX (ECHO): "I can't believe the turnout... so many people against the neural regulations..."
ALEX (ECHO): "Wait, why is security pushing so hard? We're peaceful!"
ALEX (ECHO): "Someone's shoving from behind—I'm losing balance—the railing—"
*STATIC*

The echo cuts off at the critical moment. What did you perceive?

+ [The push felt intentional] -> murder_interpretation
+ [He simply lost his balance] -> accident_interpretation
+ [There was hesitation... almost like he jumped] -> suicide_interpretation

=== murder_interpretation ===
You set evidence_murder = true.
The memory suggests foul play. Someone wanted him gone.
-> interview_witnesses

=== accident_interpretation ===
You set evidence_accident = true.
It reads like a tragic accident in the chaos of the protest.
-> interview_witnesses

=== suicide_interpretation ===
You set evidence_suicide = true.
An unusual reading, but the data suggests possible self-termination intent.
-> interview_witnesses

=== talk_reyes ===
CAPTAIN REYES: "Look, I'll be straight with you. Corporate wants this wrapped up clean."
CAPTAIN REYES: "But if there was foul play... we need to know. What's your take?"

+ [This feels like a cover-up] -> reyes_coverup
+ [I need to examine the evidence first] -> examine_evidence
+ [The victim's echo might tell us more] -> scan_victim

=== reyes_coverup ===
CAPTAIN REYES: "Careful with accusations, Agent. Without proof, that kind of talk gets people transferred."
-> scan_victim

=== examine_evidence ===
You review the physical evidence. The railing shows fresh scuff marks.
The pavement is wet from the rain. No obvious weapons nearby.

+ [Scan the victim's echo] -> scan_victim
+ [Interview witnesses] -> interview_witnesses

=== examine_scene ===
You examine the scene physically. The drop is about 20 stories - fatal for sure.
The crowd's energy is agitated. Corporate security looks tense.

+ [Scan the victim's echo] -> scan_victim
+ [Confront security about the push] -> confront_security
+ [Check for witnesses] -> interview_witnesses

=== confront_security ===
SECURITY GUARD: "I didn't push anyone! It was chaos out here!"
SECURITY GUARD: "If anything, I was trying to pull people back from the edge."

He seems defensive but credible.

-> interview_witnesses

=== interview_witnesses ===
You have two key witnesses with conflicting stories.

+ [Interview James Rodriguez - claims it was an accident] -> witness_james
+ [Interview Sarah Kim - claims it was murder] -> witness_sarah
+ [Review security footage] -> security_footage
+ [I have enough evidence - make final report] -> final_report

=== witness_james ===
JAMES RODRIGUEZ: "I was right next to him. The pavement was wet from the rain."
JAMES RODRIGUEZ: "He slipped, I'm sure of it. Just lost his footing near the edge."
JAMES RODRIGUEZ: "Tragic accident. No one pushed him that I saw."

Your scanner shows 85% neural coherence - high reliability.

+ [Note his credibility] -> witness_credible_james
+ [Press him for more details] -> witness_press_james

=== witness_credible_james ===
James appears to be telling the truth as he experienced it.
You set witness_james_credible = true.
-> after_witness

=== witness_press_james ===
JAMES RODRIGUEZ: "Look, I don't want trouble. I saw what I saw - it was an accident!"
He becomes defensive but doesn't change his story.
-> after_witness

=== witness_sarah ===
SARAH KIM: "I saw everything! The corporate security guard pushed him!"
SARAH KIM: "Number 247, I remember the badge. He made eye contact first, then shoved."
SARAH KIM: "This was murder! They're silencing dissent!"

Your scanner shows 60% neural coherence - moderate reliability, high emotional interference.

+ [She seems genuinely convinced] -> witness_believable_sarah
+ [The emotional state might distort memory] -> witness_emotional_sarah

=== witness_believable_sarah ===
Her conviction is powerful, even if the data is somewhat compromised.
You set witness_sarah_believable = true.
-> after_witness

=== witness_emotional_sarah ===
Trauma can reshape memories. Proceed with caution.
-> after_witness

=== security_footage ===
SECURITY FOOTAGE: "Camera 47-B: Protest crowd at balcony area."
SECURITY FOOTAGE: "Subject Alex Chen visible near railing. Crowd surge occurs."
SECURITY FOOTAGE: "Partial obstruction - corporate guard visible in periphery."
SECURITY FOOTAGE: "Chen goes over railing. Guard's arm movements ambiguous."

The footage is inconclusive. Guard's actions could be interpreted either way.

+ [Enhance with ethics bypass for clearer image] -> bypass_ethics
+ [Accept the ambiguous footage] -> after_security_footage

=== bypass_ethics ===
WARNING: Ethics protocols prohibit neural deep-scan without warrant.
This could damage your standing with oversight committees.

+ [Proceed with bypass] -> perform_bypass
+ [Abort enhancement] -> after_security_footage

=== perform_bypass ===
You override the safety protocols. The scanner digs deeper...

ENHANCED FOOTAGE: Guard's hand makes clear contact with Chen's back.
But wait - was it a push or an attempt to grab him from falling?

You set ethics_bypassed = true.

+ [Definitely a push] -> confirmed_push
+ [Attempted rescue] -> attempted_rescue

=== confirmed_push ===
The evidence now clearly shows intentional force applied.
-> after_security_footage

=== attempted_rescue ===
The guard was trying to save him, but failed.
-> after_security_footage

=== after_security_footage ===
-> interview_witnesses

=== after_witness ===
-> interview_witnesses

=== final_report ===
CAPTAIN REYES: "Time's up, Agent. The media is circling. What's your verdict?"

+ [ACCIDENT: Slipped in crowd chaos] -> submit_accident
+ [MURDER: Pushed by security] -> submit_murder
+ [SUICIDE: Intentional jump] -> submit_suicide
+ [INCONCLUSIVE: Need more time] -> request_extension

=== submit_accident ===
You file the report: Death by misadventure.

CAPTAIN REYES: "Corporate will be relieved. The family won't be happy though."
-> case1_conclusion

=== submit_murder ===
You file the report: Homicide by security personnel.

CAPTAIN REYES: "Bold move. This will cause waves at headquarters."
-> case1_conclusion

=== submit_suicide ===
You file the report: Intentional self-termination.

CAPTAIN REYES: "Really? That's... unexpected. The data supports this?"
-> case1_conclusion

=== request_extension ===
CAPTAIN REYES: "No can do. The mayor wants answers now. Make the call."
-> final_report

=== case1_conclusion ===
Your report is sealed and transmitted. The echo fades around you.

The truth is whatever you wrote in that report.

-> END
